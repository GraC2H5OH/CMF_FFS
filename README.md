### Backstory
#### Problems
Modeling of the company's operations is mainly done by people and they can make mistakes.
![problem](https://github.com/GraC2H5OH/CMF_FFS/blob/main/pics/problems.png)

However experienced economists and analytics could do something different instead of this. Creating a new model takes weeks. 
#### Solution
Let's use machine learning to reduce the error and eliminate the human factor.

### Goals
Soon
### What will be done
- Basic EDA
- Metrics selection
- Fitting baseline model
- Advanced models
- Cross-validation
- feature selection/engineering
- Interpretation of models results(if possible)
